Unraveling the Habits of Smokers: A Solo Data Odyssey

This BA780 project was my chance to dive deep into a smoker dataset, not just answering prescribed questions, but forging my own investigative path. Through insightful queries and handcrafted visualizations, I illuminated the complexities of smoking behavior.

- Starting with the Essentials:
My journey began with foundational questions: who smokes, how much, and where do they fall in the age spectrum? Gender breakdowns and age group comparisons painted a clear picture of smoking demographics, but my curiosity craved more.

- The Deep Dive:
Next, I zeroed in on the daily cigarette rituals of both genders, visualizing typical consumption patterns and uncovering potential differences. Then, I zoomed in on key health metrics like BMI, heart rate, and blood pressure, exploring how they varied within different smoking age groups.

- Connecting the Threads:
To understand the bigger picture, I embarked on a correlation analysis, unraveling hidden relationships between smoking habits and various health indicators. This intricate dance of data revealed fascinating patterns and potential areas for further investigation.

- Beyond the Numbers:
My exploration wasn't just about crunching numbers; it was about illuminating the human stories behind them. By delving into the data, I gained valuable insights into the lives and health of smokers, paving the way for potential interventions and support measures.

This is just a glimpse into the tapestry of findings I uncovered. I invite you to delve deeper and explore the full scope of my project.
